# About the project
This project is based on the language specifications provided by our instructor. Here, we aim to develop a robust compiler that can effectively translate source code written in our specified language into executable machine code.
# Project Overview
Our compiler project involves several key components:
1) Lexical Analysis: This phase involves breaking down the source code into tokens, identifying keywords, operators, identifiers, and literals
2) Syntax Analysis (Parsing): In this phase, the tokens generated by the lexical analyzer are parsed to check whether they conform to the grammar rules specified in the language specifications.
3) Semantic Analysis: This phase checks for the correctness of the code beyond its syntax. It ensures that variables are declared before use, types are compatible, and expressions are valid.
